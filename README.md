# 🐱 Cute Cat Tama - Virtual Pet Game

Meet your adorable virtual companion! This is a delightful HTML5 cat simulation where you get to care for the cutest, fluffiest feline friend ever created.

## 🎮 How to Play

Your mission is simple: keep your cat happy, well-fed, and absolutely adorable! 

### Controls
- **🍖 Feed Me!** - Give your kitty delicious treats to fill their tummy
- **❤️ Pet Me!** - Show your cat some love with gentle pets and cuddles

### 🐾 Cat Stats to Watch

Your feline friend has three important stats that affect their mood and appearance:

**🍽️ Hunger (0-100)**
- 85-100: *"I'm starving! Feed me NOW! 😿"*
- 60-85: *"So hungry... need some treats... 🥺"*
- 30-60: *"A little peckish. Could eat! 😼"*
- 0-30: *"I'm full and happy! Purrrr! 🥰"*

**🎈 Fatness (10-100)**
- Watch your kitty grow rounder and more adorable as you feed them!
- Thin cats need more treats, chunky cats are extra cuddly
- The fatter your cat gets, the more paws become visible!

**💖 Happiness (0-100)**
- Pet your cat to boost their mood
- But be careful - overly happy cats might get annoyed by too much petting!
- Happy cats purr more and have sparkly eyes
